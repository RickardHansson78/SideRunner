SideRunnerTest
This is my Side runner where you survivor wall that kill you if you to slow.

Find my binary under the shipping version Windows 10 package under Releases tab as a rar.

Part 1
In this first pass at the Siderunner game, I have used object oriented design to decide which class objects to create in my game. 
I have achieved a loose coupling of the classes by making a siderunner survivor game where a wall pushes you if you are slow enough 
the wall kills you and you can die from being locked in if you can't move forward or have to avoid spikes I had to search for solutions
until I got it working, but before that it was the wall that didn't work
Talking about class 1 goes here. I have built the old man and the track as if in two parts and done it like that, you have to jump free
on ledges and escape the wall that comes after you only that I had to build the wall and then the track itself but I succeeded but then 
I haven't been able to so you get to the next level/track but I have done so there are and will be a few tracks but right now just focused on the track itself.

Talking about class 2 goes here

I also used Unreal's container classes and methods to...some kind of interesting appeal goes here.

Part 2
Not done yet, write more about this later.
Make part 2 with a quit and have problem with 2 charactors and score in the end of the level the game crashes and crashers also then i compile the game too.
